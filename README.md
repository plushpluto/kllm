Welcome to KLLM, an advanced project focused on core kernel AI development, integrating on-device language models (LMs) for efficient and powerful AI capabilities.

## Overview

KLLM stands for Kernel-Level Language Model, a cutting-edge framework designed to inject language models directly at the kernel level. This project aims to revolutionize the integration of AI within the core operating system, providing seamless and energy-efficient performance for on-device applications.

## Features

### Core Kernel AI Development

Leveraging the power of the kernel, KLLM ensures that AI functionalities are deeply integrated within the system. This deep integration allows for faster and more efficient processing of AI tasks, as the core functionalities are embedded at the lowest level of the operating system. This approach minimizes latency, enhances security, and provides a stable foundation for running complex AI models. Additionally, robust encoding methods are used to maintain data integrity and quick access.

### On-Device LMs
